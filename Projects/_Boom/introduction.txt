StudioVIX is a startup in the creative officespace market. Their mission is to
help create spaces that stimulate creativity by products that inspire new solutions
and help facilitate more free thought through biophilic design. As a designbased startup
the focus lies on easthetics and timeless design.

The original product linup existed of a whiteboard design and a drawingsheet dispenser. 
Through a hackaton/brainstorm workshop with a company supplying sustainably sourced floortiles
the initial plans where made for a partnership to create an officeforest. therefore StudioVIX 
desided to start the design of a tree-like product.

The product idea, and with that the design brief, is as follows: A multipurpose treelike
piece of furniture that functions as a canvas for new ideas through the use of feltmaterial 
to use for attaching puneses. This felt should at the same time also funtion for sounddampening
in larger officespaces. 

As this was my first furniture design project, I started off by exploring both home- and office furniture
stores. getting a feel for the types of techniques used, understanding the challanges that this class
of product comes with and getting inspiration for easthetics and styles to use in the design.

Continueing the process I started exploring how to realize the posed product idea. Mainly through doing scetches of trees
and treelike structures to see what form or construction would be a good fit for the practical requirements, such as the ability to ship,
the manufacturability and component density, but also finding something that fits the style of the previous productlineup. 

This eventually lead to the desision to go for a simple 3legged steel frame with a large felt leaf. The next challange was defining
how the legs come together. There are some familiar designs that use a 3 legged construction, but in order to stay true to the studio's 
style we chose to find a way to...
